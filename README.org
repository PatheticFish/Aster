Detailed specification to come

** PowerShell script policy
By default, PowerShell will refuse to run scripts that did not originate on your machine.
To use Aster and run the examples, you will have to perform the following steps:

*** Set Execution Policy
You may have to allow PowerShell to run external scripts at all with [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/Set-ExecutionPolicy?view=powershell-5.1][Set-ExecutionPolicy]].
#+BEGIN_SRC powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
#+END_SRC
Please also consider the -Scope [Process | CurrentUser | LocalMachine] parameter when performing this operation.

*** Unblocking Aster files
Secondly, Aster's files must be marked as safe (else you will be asked to confirm running each class file used by Aster)
This can be accomplished by changing the working directory to Aster's root folder and running the following command.
#+BEGIN_SRC powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File
#or the more concise: gci -r|Unblock-File
#+END_SRC
There may be a better way that I am unaware of.


Finally, test the setup by running the example file
#+BEGIN_SRC powershell
.\Examples\ControllerExample.ps1
#+END_SRC
